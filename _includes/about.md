### Bio
I was born in [Soria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soria), a small city in central Spain, and grew up near Madrid. In 2009 I started my bachelor degree on Audiovisual Systems Engineering at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home), during which I had the chance to study one year as an Erasmus fellow at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany. In 2013 I obtained a research fellowship to complete my bachelor thesis at the [Group of Multimedia Processing (GPM)](http://gpm.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/) with [Fernando Fernández Martínez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_Fernandez-Martinez) and [Fernando Díaz de María](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/en/Detalle/Organismo_C/1371211308508/1371211309638/Fernando_Diaz_de_Maria). At the GPM I worked as a research and teaching assistant during my master studies, working on projects related to image processing and computer vision. The main topic of my research was the automatic recognition of aesthetics and elicited affect of natural videos.

In February 2016 I was selected as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellow at [Prof. Peter König](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html)'s lab at the Department of Cognitive Science of the University of Osnabrück and at [EyeQuant](https://eyequant.com), in Berlin. Being part of the Innovative Training Network [NexGenVis](https://www.nextgenvis.eu) gave me the opportunity to collaborate with a great network of PhD students at leading [laboratories](https://www.nextgenvis.eu/partners/) in the field of visual neuroscience. During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at at the Spinoza Center for Neuroimaging in Amsterdam with [Dr. Serge Dumoulin](http://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/) and at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of the University of Cambridge with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/). In November 2020, I defended my [PhD thesis]({{ site.url }}/thesis.pdf), and in December I moved to Montreal to start as a postdoc at [Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/), with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/).

My main research focus is on brain-inspired deep learning and computational neuroscience. In particular, I have studied data augmentation as a [biologically and perceptually](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03852) informed way of training convolutional neural networks, compared to explicit regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout. Besides, I have collaborated in studies of visual perception and visual attention involving eye-tracking and analysis of fMRI data. At Mila, I am currently working on projects to fight climate change using machine learning, such as an educational tool to [visualise the effects of climate change](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/visualizing-climate-change/) on real photos.  

### Beyond research
When I am not analyzing data, coding or reading papers, I like spending time with my friends, doing things as varied as having a conversation over a beer or a cup of coffee or tea, playing music, reading books, climbing, going to punk-rock concerts and festivals, travelling... 

If I had a second life, I would like to be a musician at a symphonic orchestra. I guess it is because I have played the violin since I have memories. Fortunately, this life has also given me the chance to play the violin at several orchestras and in a band in Berlin, [The Broken Jug Ramblers](https://brokenjugramblers.bandcamp.com/), among many other unforgettable musical experiences. I also played the bagpipe with a big pipe band from Madrid, [Lume de Biqueira](https://www.lumedebiqueira.es/en/), which was a lot of fun.
