# USS 2021 Code of conduct
In order to have safe and pleasant exchanges during this event, it is required from every participant to read and follow this USS 2021 Code of conduct. Since USS 2021 applies a strict zero tolerance policy, participants who fail to follow the Code of conduct will be banned or expelled from the event, the same way they would be removed during an in-person event.

The main important concept ruling this code of conduct is respect. Respect can take many forms:
- respect of the origins (physical appearance, nationality, ethnicity, etc.)
- respect of the beliefs (religious, cultural, etc.)
- respect of the age
- respect of the gender identity (or preferences)
- respect of the status
- respect regarding physical or mental handicap
- respect regarding personal experiences (academic and others)
- respect regarding differences in general

Difference is what makes each individual unique, and what allows each of us to bring our special contribution to our research community. It shouldn’t be used to discriminate, it should be encouraged and supported. It is also important to acknowledge that not everyone has the same level of understanding of every field of interest covered by this conference and that we all bring a different academic background to the community. This variety is important and allows us to push forward the boundaries of science research. We all have our specialties and we can all learn from each other.

## Reporting
Should you encounter a situation that makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to any member of the USS 2021 organization committee as soon as possible. The USS 2021 committee will contact you for a follow-up, and proceed to appropriate actions to reestablish safe and pleasant exchanges.
