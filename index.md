#### Brief academic bio
I am an assistant professor at the Université de Montréal at [DIRO](https://diro.umontreal.ca) and at [Mila](https://mila.quebec) (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), in [Tiohtià:ke](https://www.concordia.ca/indigenous/resources/territorial-acknowledgement.html) / Montréal. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Prof. David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/). I defended my [PhD thesis]({{ site.url }}/thesis.pdf) in 2020 at the University of Osnabrück, which I started in 2016 with [Prof. Peter König](https://portal.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/~NBP/PeterKoenig.html), as a fellow of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN [NexGenVis](https://www.nextgenvis.eu). I obtained my B.Sc and M.Sc. at the [University Carlos III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home) and I was a visiting PhD student at the University of Cambridge with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/) and at the Spinoza Center for Neuroimaging with [Dr. Serge Dumoulin](http://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/).

#### Current projects
My current work focuses on **machine learning research methods that can facilitate scientific discoveries to tackle the climate crisis and health challenges**. For example, I work on developing generative methods, such as GFlowNets, and active learning algorithms for materials and drug discovery. In particular, I am working on multi-fidelity active learning methods, crystal structure generation, electrocatalyst design or molecular conformation sampling. I am also leading the development of [a GFlowNet python library](https://github.com/alexhernandezgarcia/gflownet), together with many collaborators. With [Victor Schmidt](https://vict0rs.ch/), [Sasha Luccioni](https://www.sashaluccioni.com/) and a larger wonderful team, I also helped create [ThisClimateDoesNotExist.com](https://thisclimatedoesnotexist.com/), a website to help us visualise the impacts of climate change in our own backyard.

#### Broader research interests
Besides developing potentially impactful machine learning applications, I am also interested in **brain-inspired deep learning and computational neuroscience**. I believe that machine learning and neuroscience can highly benefit each other and I am interested in exploring and exploiting their synergies.

#### My vision of science
Besides my research, I am a strong proponent of open science in the broadest sense, and I try to contribute to it with my actions and by getting involved in discussions about how to make science more inclusive, equitable, open, reproducible, transparent and environmentally conscious. One way I channel and feed these ideas is by being active in the community of [Science for the People](https://sftp-canada.org/). I often participate as mentor in initiatives to support students from under-represented groups, such as the [AI4Good Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/), the [Fatima Fellowship](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/home) or LatinX in AI. At Mila, I have been a member of the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee and a member of the Sustainability Committee. With amazing colleagues, I co-organise the Mila reading group _Against Military AI_. In 2021/2022, I was the elected postdoctoral Mila Lab Representative. At NeurIPS 2021, I co-organised a [workshop on pre-registration in machine learning](https://preregister.science/) and in 2022 the [AI Helps Ukraine - Charity Conference](https://aihelpsukraine.cc/).

#### Contact
If you are looking for graduate or postdoc positions to work on machine learning for science to have an impact on tackling climate change and health challenges, I'd love to hear from you!
