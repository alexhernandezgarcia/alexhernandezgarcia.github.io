## The carbon emissions of AI

.center[![:scale 30%](../assets/images/slides/ai-env-impact/server.jpg)]

---

## Why does AI consume so much energy ?

--

.highlight1[Short and simple answer]: Artificial intelligence models are run in computers and computers consume energy.

--

> _But a computer doesn't require so much energy, does it?_

--

> _Not really... But it depends!_

--

> _So?_

--

This question and its answers are unfortunately more complex than it seems on the surface. Let's consider these other questions:

- Why does transportation consume so much energy?
- Why does food production consume so much energy?

???

Walking and biking is not energy-demanding, but transportation within car culture and mindless flying is.

Traditional agriculture is not energy-demanding, but food production based on animal products and fertilizers is.

--

.conclusion[Artificial intelligence is not necessarily energy-intensive. Small-scale, effective AI is in theory possible. The main problem is the scale we have reached.]

---

## Why does AI consume so much energy ?
### A more subtle answer

## Why does AI consume so much energy ?
### A more subtle answer

--

It is important to distinguish the two main phases in the life of an artificial intelligence model: .highlight1[training] and .highlight1[deployment]

--

- .highlight1[Training]: This is the process of adjusting the weights that determine the mathematical operations in the neural network so that the model successfully performs the desired task.

Some models can be trained on a laptop in minutes or hours. The models behind systems like ChatGPT require several weeks and many powerful computers.

--

- .highlight1[Deployment]: This is the use phase of the model once it has been trained.

Some models are only moderately used. Systems like ChatGPT are currently used every minute by millions of users.

--

.conclusion[It is this large-scale deployment of huge models what poses the main problem in a context of climate crisis.]

???

Talk about scaling is all you need and this philosophy promoted from the industry as part of a capitalist mindset.

## Estimation of the carbon of emissions of artificial intelligence

What are the factors influencing the greenhouse gas emissions of AI models?

1. .highlight1[Training time], $T$: total time using computational resources (hours).
2. .highlight1[Electric power], $P$: of the compute hardware (watts).
3. .highlight1[Carbon intensity], $I$: the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced by the energy source. (grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour).

.references[
Luccioni and Hernandez-Garcia. [Counting Carbon: A Survey of Factors Influencing the Emissions of Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08476). arXiv 2302.08476, 2023.
]

--

The amount of CO2 equivalent [CO2eq] emitted from training a machine learning model, $C$:

$$C = T \times P \times I = E \times I$$

--

.conclusion[It is quite simple to get a rough estimate, but it is really difficult to calculate exactly the energy due to specific processes.]

---

## Estimation of the carbon of emissions of artificial intelligence
### Example

Consider a model trained on a typical GPU for 24 hours, with hydroelectric power.

1. .highlight1[Training time], $T$: 24 hours
2. .highlight1[Electric power], $P$: 200 W = 0.2 kW
3. .highlight1[Carbon intensity], $I$: 63 g CO2eq. / kWh

--

The amount of CO2 equivalent [CO2eq] emitted from training this machine learning model, $C$:

$$C = 24~\text{hours} \times 0.2~\text{kW}~ \times 63~\text{g CO2eq / kWh} = 302~\text{g CO2eq}$$

--

302 g CO2eq is the equivalent of driving about 1 km with an average passenger car.

## carbon emissions of AI

.context[The main factors are training time, electric power of hardware and carbon intensity.]

In 2022, with Sasha Luccioni, we conducted an analysis of the carbon emissions of 95 machine learning models, asking the authors about the details of the training process.

---

## Estimation of the 
## carbon emissions of AI

.context[The main factors are training time, electric power of hardware and carbon intensity.]

The carbon intensity depends on the energy grid and the electric power is similar for the various hardware options. .highlight1[The remaining factor is training time].

.center[![:scale 70%](../assets/images/slides/counting-carbon/energy_co2_sources.png)]

--

.conclusion[We found very large differences in training time across models and thus in the CO2eq emissions.]

???

Charging an average smartphone uses about 22 Wh.

In terms of training time, the models in our sample range from just about 15 minutes (total GPU/TPU time) up to more than 400,000 hours, with a median of 72 hours, pointing again to large variance in our sample. While the maximum of 400,000 GPU hours (equivalent to about 170 days with 100 GPUs) in our sample seems very large, note that the total training time of GPT-3 was estimated to be over 3.5 million hours (14.8 days with 10,000 GPUs).

The total carbon emissions of the models analyzed in our study is about 253 tons of CO2eq, which is equivalent to about 100 flights from London to San Francisco or from Nairobi to Beijing.

## Estimation of the carbon emissions of AI
### Comparison of models

The .highlight1[lightest model] was trained in .highlight1[15 minutes], but .highlight2[one of the models needed 400,000 hours].

--

The .highlight1[total carbon emissions] of all models analysed in our sample (95) was about .highlight1[253 metric tons of CO2eq], which is equivalent to .highlight1[about 100 flights] from London to San Francisco.

--

.highlight1[GPT-3], the "predecessor" of ChatGPT, needed .highlight1[3,5 million training hours] (14,8 days with 10,000 GPUs) and thus about .highlight1[500 tons of CO2eq], which corresponds to .highlight1[450 transatlantic flights].

## Comparison of AI models
### What can be said about modern large language models?

First and foremost, big tech companies provide nearly no information about the energy used by their models.

It is only thanks to the work of researchers that we know more and more:

--

- The carbon emissions of training BLOOM were estimated in 25 tons of CO2eq. .cite[(Luccioni et al., 2022)]
- At the peak of ChatGPT popularity in 2023, the tool consumed about 564 MWh of electricity per day, equivalent to the daily consumption of about 19,000 families in the United States. .cite[(de Vries, 2023)]

## Initiatives to reduce the impact of AI

1. Increasing awareness about environmental impacts
2. Improving the transparency about resource utilisation
3. Using artificial intelligence tools in a moderate, proportional and conscious way.
4. Developing more efficient models
5. Promoting more efficient models

--

Regarding efficiency, it is important to always remember [Jevons' paradox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800905001084?via%3Dihub): technological efficiency gains often increase overall resource use.

]

???

For example, historically, despite a one hundredfold efficiency increase from the first light bulb to a contemporary LED bulb, increase in electricity demand for light bulbs has entirely offset these gains. A landmark study concluded that “global energy use for lighting has experienced 100% rebound over 300 years, six continents, and five technologies” (Saunders and Tsao 2012; Tsao et al. 2010). (Insolvent)

100x efficiency gains since first bulb but 2x more energy usage

## Beyond environmental impact

There is a large body of research studying the negative social impacts of AI:
- Centralisation of power and increase of inequality
- Exploitative working conditions
- Discrimination of racialised people
- Propagation of discriminatory biases
- Spread of mis/disinformation
- Infringement of creators rights

???

- Mention Microsoft's deals with fossil fuel companies
- Major tech companies like Microsoft and Google just reported rises in resource uses previously unheard of, stopped carbon offsetting, and announced that they would miss their already loose (Hoffmann, 2022) sustainability pledges, precisely because of their large scale AI roll-out (e.g. Marx, 2024; Metz, 2024; Rathi & Bass, 2024).

- systems and infrastructures that use artificial intelligence

In my opinion, considering myself as an implicated subjec is helpful for developing action plans and allowing myself to .highlight1[adjust my level of involvement].

--

My personal attitude:

1. Understand in more depth not only the direct but also indirect impacts of my work.

--
2. Develop strategies to mitigate my own impact.

--
3. Consider refusal as a valid attitude.

--
4. Develop strategies to mitigate systemic impact.

.highlight1[Artificial intelligence] should not be seen as the solution to the climate crisis and we have seen how it can make it worse. However, some people do believe that it .highlight1[may be used in multiple applications] connected to.highlight1[mitigation] of climate change and .highglight1[adaptation] to it.

- Energy optimisation of buildings and infrastructures.
- Optimisation of production and distribution of energy
- Prediction and management of natural resources
- Optimisation and management of transport networks
- Improvement of climate models
- Raising awareness about climate change
- Design of new materials for sustainability

## Can AI be _truly_ for good?

--

> _Any AI technology in the sustainability struggle will, if continuing on the current path, very likely do more harm than good and might even be a distraction from the actually relevant societal tasks of a sustainability transformation._ .cite[(Rehak, 2024)]

--

> _Sustainable AI is the technical solution to the climate crisis from a techno-solutionist vantage point simply reproducing the status quo. The enthusiasm for sustainable AI primarily serves hegemonic interests, rather than genuinely aiming for resource-friendly and ethical solutions._ .cite[(Schütze, 2024)]

## Summary and discussion

- Artificial intelligence can be very energy intensive due to the large-scale and widespread deployment.
    - But small-scale machine learning models do exist.
- AI is responsible for other severe environmental impacts such as water withdrawal and materials usage.
- There is also a wide range of ethical and social impacts of AI, including the increasing use of AI in warfare.
- A holistic and radical perspective allows us to see the entanglement of all these impacts.
- Machine learning may play a role in the mitigation of and adaption to the climate crisis, but it is important to critically examine this role.

- Could AI be sustainable? Under what conditions?
- Small AI instead of scaling and general purpose _AGI_? Digital degrowth?
- What is the role of AI in sustainability?
- What is our implication on the AI impacts as users, developers, scientists, policy-makers...?
