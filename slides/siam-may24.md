## Crystal structure generation in the literature

Example: .highlight2[Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE)]: a diffusion process that moves .highlight1[atomic coordinates] towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. The key idea is to learn the diffusion process from the data distribution of stable materials. .cite[(Xie et al., 2022)]

## Crystal structure generation in the literature

Example: .highlight2[UniMat]: A denoising diffusion model learns to move atoms from random locations back to their original locations. Atoms not present in the crystal are moved to the null location during the denoising process, allowing crystals with an arbitrary number of atoms to be generated.

## A domain-inspired approach
### Crystal structure parameters

.context[CDVAE and other works tackle crystal structure generation in the space of atom coordinates.]

--

Instead of optimising the atom positions by learning from a small data set, we draw .highlight1[inspiration from theoretical crystallography to sample crystals in a lower-dimensional space of crystal structure parameters].

--

.highlight2[Space group]: symmetry operations of a repeating pattern in space that leave the pattern unchanged.

- There are 17 symmetry groups in 2 dimensions (wallpaper groups).
- There are 230 space groups in 3 dimensions.

## GFlowNets as the generative framework
### 3 key ingredients

--

<br>

1. .highlight1[Diversity] as an objective.

--
    - Given a score or reward function $R(x)$, learn to _sample objects $x$ proportionally to the reward_.
--
2. .highlight1[Compositionality] in the sample generation.

--
    - A meaningful decomposition of samples $x$ into multiple sub-states $s_0\rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow x$ can yield generalisable patterns.
--
3. .highlight1[Deep learning] to learn from the generated samples.

--
    - A machine learning model can learn the transition function $F(s\rightarrow s')$ and generalise the patterns.

## 1. Diversity as an objective

.context[Many existing approaches treat scientific discovery as an _optimisation_ problem.]

<br>
Given a reward or objective function $R(x)$, GFlowNet can be seen a generative model trained to sample objects $x \in \cal X$ according to .highlight1[a sampling policy $\pi(x)$ proportional to the reward $R(x)$]: 

--

.left-column[
$$\pi(x) = \frac{R(x)}{Z} \propto R(x)$$
]

.right-column[
$$Z = \sum_{x' \in \cal X} R(x')$$
]

## GFlowNet approach
### Advantages

.context[We generate materials in the lower-dimensional space of crystal structure parameters.]

* Constructing materials by their crystal structure parameters allows us to introduce .highlight1[physicochemical and geometric _hard_ constraints]:
--

    * Charge neutrality of the composition.
    * Compatibility of composition and space group.
    * Hierarchical structure of the space group.
    * Compatibility of lattice parameters and lattice system.
--
* .highlight1[Searching in the lower-dimensional space] of crystal structure parameters may be more efficient than in the space of atom coordinates.

--
* Provided we have access to a predictive model of a material property, we can .highlight1[flexibly generate materials with desirable properties].

--
* We can .highlight1[flexibly sample materials with specific characteristics, such as composition or space group]. 

---

## Crystal-GFlowNet
### Properties

We can train a Crystal-GFN with any reward function, provided it is computationally tractable. Therefore, we can use it to .highlight1[generate materials with different properties]. 
--
We have tested the following properties:

- .highlight1[Formation energy per atom] [eV/atom], via a pre-trained machine learning model.
- .highlight1[Electronic band gap] [eV] (squared distance to a target value, 1.34 eV), via a pre-trained machine learning model.
- .highlight1[Unit cell density] [g/cm<sup>3</sup>], calculated _exactly_ from the GFN outputs.

--

.highlight1[Coming soon]: pre-trained machine learning model to predict the ionic conductivity [S/cm].

## Crystal-GFlowNet
### Proxy ML models of the formation energy and the band gap

- MLP architecture
- Inputs:
    - Space group embedding
    - Composition embedding as in PhAST (Duval et al., 2022)
    - Standardised lattice parameters
- Trained on MatBench (Materials Project)
    - Mean absolute error: 
        - Formation energy: 0.10 eV/atom $\pm$ 0.005
        - Band gap: 0.321 eV $\pm$ 0.003
- Reward: $R(x) = \exp(-\frac{MLP(x)}{T})$

---

## Crystal-GFlowNet
### Experiments

- Space groups: all 113 space groups present in the MatBench data set.
- Compositions:
    - Up to 5 unique elements from the these 22 elements: ts: H, Li, B, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Se. Th (22 most common elements in the training set). 
    - Up to 16 atoms per element (80 atoms in total)
- Lattice parameters:
    - Lengths: 0.9-100 angstroms.
    - Angles: 50-150°.
    - These ranges contain the bulk of the data set (excluding outliers).

---

## Results
### Density

What do we expect Crystal-GFN to sample?

- Small length lattice parameters (small volume): 
--
4.9 Å compared to 8.3 Å in the validation dataset. &#10004;
--

- Denser packing space group: 
--
We see a shift towards spacegroups from the cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal lattices (81, 99, 115, 195, 200, 207, 215, 221). &#10004;
--

- Higher number of atoms (larger mass): 
--
58.8 atoms on average compared to 48.1 over the validation set. &#10004;
--

- Heavier elements (larger mass): 
--
Heavier such as Se, Cu, Ni are sampled the most often. &#10004;

## Results
### Restricted sampling

We restrict the sampling space at sampling time:

- A: The composition is restricted to only elements Fe and O, with a maximum of 10 atoms per element.
- B: We sample in the ternary space for Li-Mn-O, keeping the element count to maximum 16 atoms.
- C: We restrict the space groups to only cubic lattices.
- D: We restrict the range of the lattice parameters to lengths between 10 and 20 angstroms and angles between 75 and 135 degrees.

- All crystal systems, lattice systems and point symmetries found in the 10,000 samples.
    - 4 out of 8 crystal-lattice systems in the top-100.
    - 4 out of the 5 point symmetries in the top-100.
--
- All 22 elements found in the 10,000 samples.
    - 15 out of 22 elements in the top-100.
--
- 73 out of 113 space groups (65 %) found in the 10,000 samples

## Summary and conclusions

* Instead of generating crystal structures in the space of atomic positions, we proposed to sample in a lower-dimensional space of crystallographic properties (space group, composition and lattice parameters).
* This representation allowed us to introduce .highlight1[physicochemical and structural _hard_ constraints], reducing the search space and improving validity.
    * Crystal-GFN was trained in 30 hours in a CPU-only machine.
* Our results show that we can generate .highlight1[diverse, high scoring samples with the desired constraints].
* We can flexibly select the desired material characteristics.
* The .highlight1[framework can be flexibly extended] with more constraints, crystal structure descriptors (atomic positions) and other properties.
