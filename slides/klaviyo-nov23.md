* Visual perception is sensitive to unrealistic scenes:
    * Water texture (reflections, luminosity, etc.)

* The algorithm was meant to be deployed _in the wild_ and should work with highly variant range of photos.
* We had to overcome the lack of training data: there is no data set of photos of _before and after_ the flood.

Concrete: The properties and performance of concrete can be tailored to meet design requirements by varying the type and quantity of the mixture constituents (e.g., cement, water, aggregate, and admixtures). Traditional approaches for designing concrete mixtures often rely on trial-and-error, iterative proportioning, processing, and characterization until the target properties are achieved.

Concrete: it is possible to optimize the compressive strength of concrete mixtures by adjusting the water/cement ratio, total aggregate/cement ratio, and coarse aggregate/total aggregate ratio6. Yet the practical application of this iterative refinement approach is limited by the exponential increase in the number of specimens and experiments when complex concrete mixtures are studied and several compositional parameters are simultaneously considered as combinatorial variables. As a result, materials development in concrete science involves time-consuming validation/development cycles from laboratory trials to field applications. Efforts to accelerate knowledge acquisition and materials design in concrete science are thus of paramount importance.

Beginning in the 1980s, the development of microstructural models of cement hydration has enabled a fundamental understanding of microstructure–property relationships in concrete7, which has marked the second paradigm. By applying basic laws of kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanics, and providing analytical solutions to cement hydration. Successful demonstrations include the three-dimensional cement hydration and microstructure development model (CEMHYD3D)8,9; the hydration, morphology, and structural development model (HYMOSTRUC)10; the integrated particle kinetics model11; and the microstructural modeling platform (μic)

Concrete: However, the complex nature of cement hydration makes it challenging to develop accurate and generalizable models, and these modeling approaches, to varying degrees, rely on thermochemical, physical, and structural data that must be obtained either from accurate experimental observations or from calculations at the atomistic and molecular scales.

In this context, the use of density-functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been explored in concrete science since the 2000s owing to the ever-growing computing power16. This has given rise to the third paradigm (computational science; Fig. 1), where the first-principle models have been integrated and employed to further describe cementitious materials properties and improve understanding of cement hydration. Related simulation efforts have focused primarily on cementitious phases such as the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel, the essential reaction product of cement hydration.

Concrete: However, these computational techniques require considerable computational resources and thus come with significant challenges, such as their limited time scales and the relatively small number of atoms in a simulated system. In addition, it may be difficult to validate these simulations with experiments, given the small time and length scales and high-fidelity measurements required.

By leveraging existing datasets with data-driven models, ML can automatically learn implicit patterns and extract valuable information while accounting for the inherent complexity of concrete mixtures and their properties.

## GFlowNet in a nutshell

<br>
Given a reward or objective function $R(x)$, GFlowNet can be seen a generative model trained to sample objects $x \in \cal X$ according to .highlight1[a sampling policy $\pi(x)$ proportional to the reward $R(x)$]: $\pi(x) \propto R(x)$


&rarr; Sampling proportionally to the reward function induces .highlight1[multi-modal search and diversity].

--

.left-column[
The policy $\pi_{\theta}(x)$ is modelled by a deep neural network, parameterised by $\theta$, thus providing .highlight1[amortised inference].

&rarr; Amortised inference can be thought of as _exploration with memory_, which induces .highlight1[systematic generalisation].

## GFlowNet in a nutshell

* Objects $x \in \cal X$ are constructed through a sequence of steps $\tau$ from an action space $\cal A$.
* At each step of the trajectory $\tau=(s_0\rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow s_f)$, we get a partially constructed object $s$ in state space $\cal S$.
* This induces a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A})$, with all possible constructions in the domain.

$$\sum\_{s' \in \text{Parent}(s)} F\_\theta(s' \rightarrow s) = \sum\_{s'' \in \text{Child}(s)} F\_\theta(s \rightarrow s')$$

**Theorem**: For a consistent flow $F$ with terminal flow set as the reward $F(x\rightarrow s_f)=R(x)$, the forward policy samples $x$ proportionally to $R(x)$.
$$\pi(x)\propto R(x)$$

**Corollary**: The flow at $s_0$, $F(s_0)$ is the partition function $Z$!

The objective function is the free energy estimated by NUPACK. The (simulated) lower fidelity oracle is a transformer trained with 1 million sequences.

* GFlowNet generates much more .highlight1[diverse] and .highlight1[novel] samples than the baselines.

* AmortizedBO generated nonsensical peptides because it is designed for fixed-length sequences.
* Methods such as COMs, which perform local search around known candidates, perform poorly when the goal is to generate .highlight1[large], .highlight1[diverse] and .highlight1[novel] batches.

## Generation of Crystal Structures
### _Work in progress..._

We are working on using GFlowNets to explore the space of crystals and sample new, diverse, stable materials that optimise certain properties.

* State space: stoichiometry, crystal system, point symmetry, space group, Wyckoff positions, etc.
* Action space: the constrained selection of crystal structure parameters and properties. 
* Advantage of GFlowNets: flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge in the generation structure.

### Applications

* Electrocatalyst design
* Solid-state ionic super conductors
* ...

## Summary and conclusions

* There is a mismatch between the magnitude of the climate crisis and the public's concern about it.
* We have used AI to generate .highlight1[personalised visualisations of extreme climate events], to help mitigate the psychological distance with climate change.
* The climate crisis requires .highlight1[accelerating the pace of scientific discovery].
* AI-driven scientific discovery demands learning methods that can .highlight1[efficiently discover diverse candidates in very large, multi-modal search spaces].
* .highlight1[GFlowNet] is a new learning method that can address some of the limitations of AI-drive scientific discovery.
* GFlowNet has been proven successful or is promising in practically relevant and challenging tasks, such as .highlight1[biological sequence design], .highlight1[molecular conformation], .highlight1[crystal structure generation], etc.
