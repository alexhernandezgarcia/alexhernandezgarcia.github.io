Students from the Université de Montréal or Mila are welcome to audit this course as long as there is available classroom space. However, for those who can register, university enrolment is highly encourage. Auditors are also welcome to participate in some of the course work, but this requires additional work and organisational efforts on the instructors side, and commitment on the auditors side. For this reasons, auditors are kindly requested to submit their contact information and intentions for the course via this form.
