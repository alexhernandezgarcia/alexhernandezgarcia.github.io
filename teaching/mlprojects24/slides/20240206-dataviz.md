- The class is going to be a mix of lecture and demonstration

---

## Format of the class and objective

This class will be a combination of lecture and demonstration.

The .highlight1[goal] is that by the end of the class:

* You have learnt the core concepts of data visualisation.
* You know some ingredients that make a _good_ figure.
* You know some ingredients that make a _bad_ figure.

* Figures in scientific publications and technical reports are often the .highlight1[main support of the key results].
* Data visualisation has the potential of enabling the .highlight1[understanding] of complex and large numerical relationships .highlight1[at a glance]
* Figures can create a successful .highlight1[communication channel between you], the author of a complex data analysis, .highlight1[and your audience]: .highlight1[data visualisation is akin to a metaphor to convey a complex idea]

---

## General ideas

#### Common, but incorrect assumptions

--

* Readers read the abstract, introduction and methods before seeing the figures. ![:scale 1em](../../../assets/images/slides/misc/wrong_red.png)
--

* If I can interpret the figure, my readers can interpret the figures too. ![:scale 1em](../../../assets/images/slides/misc/wrong_red.png)

--

#### Generally good ideas and indications 

* Many readers examine the figures first.
* Figures should stand on their own and be self-explanatory.
* Figures should be designed for a broad audience, not for yourself.
* A likely successful approach is:
    1. Identify the key messages.
    2. Draw visualizations about them .
    3. Write the paper or report around them.

## Ten simple rules for better figures

## Ten simple rules for better figures
### 1. Know your audience

> "\[I\]t is important to identify, as early as possible in the design process, the audience and the message the visual is to convey".

A figure should stand by itself when seen by the target audience. It should contain all the relevant information the audience _needs_ to know. Different audiences know different things.

* Is the figure for yourself and collaborators?
* Is it for a specialised audience?
* Is it for the general public?

### 2. Identify your message

> "Only after identifying the message will it be worth the time to develop your figure".

</figure>

.left-column[
* How can a figure simplify the main message, which is otherwise likely to be hard to express in words or in a table with numbers?
* A good figure do not only _represent_ the data, but is at the service of the main message.

### 4. Captions are not optional

> "The caption explains how to read the figure and provides additional precision for what cannot be graphically represented".

* Figures can hardly explain everything by themselves.
* Captions support the images on being self-explanatory.
* Captions can further highlight the key message of the figure.

</figure>

* Defaults are fine enough for _quick and dirty_ visualisation, but the final figures require careful design and optimisation.

### 7. Do not mislead the reader

> "\[If we rely on the automatic settings of your software it is easy to\] inadvertently misle\[a\]d your readers into visually believing something that does not exist in your data".

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: small"></figcaption>
</figure>

* Wrong choices also lead to misleading plots: avoid pie charts and 3D charts.
* As a rule of thumb, use the simplest possible plot.

> "\[C\]hartjunk may include the use of too many colors, too many labels, gratuitously colored back- grounds, useless grid lines, etc.".

* Background colour in a plot is generally a bad idea

## Ten simple rules for better figures
### 9. Message trumps beauty

> "It is important to know \[the standards in each scientific domain\], because they facilitate a more direct comparison".

> "However, most of the time, you may need to design a brand-new figure, because there is no standard way of describing your research".

  questionable.</figcaption>

### 10. Get the right tool

> "Depending on the type of visual you’re trying to create, there is generally a dedicated tool that will do what you’re trying to achieve".

* It is important to get familiar with at least one tool for producing reproducible plots. In Python, popular tools are `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* There exist multiple great open-source options for computer graphics:
    * Inkscape: professional vector graphics
    * GIMP: Photo editing
    * TikZ and PGF: TeX packages for programmatic graphics.
    * D3.js: interactive data-based graphical forms

## Beyond bar plots

.context[Bar plots are a very common choice. However, they are rarely a good choice.]

<br>
.highlight1[Conclusions]

* Avoid bar plots unless you know for sure it is the right choice: they are appropriate only for counts and proportions and when the deviation of the means is very small or zero (rarely is).
* Scatterplots are usually a better choice.
* If the distribution has few data points, show them all and represent a summary statistic.
* If the distribution has too many data points, show the distribution with a curve, a violin plot, a box plot, etc.
