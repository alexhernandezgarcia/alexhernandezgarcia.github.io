## Evaluation

You will be evaluated entirely according to their work on projects and the final grade will be based on the following criteria, all with equivalent weight: 

* .highlight1[Difficulty] of the project
* .highlight1[Quality and performance] of the developed algorithms: suitability of the chosen methods, technical rigour, results, etc.
* .highlight1[Written report] completeness, clarity, technical soundness, analysis, etc.
* .highlight1[Oral presentation] effectiveness, clarity of the presentation, etc.
* .highlight1[Code] clarity, documentation, modularity, extendability, etc.

The evaluation will be at the project level, that is we will consider that the results, the report, the presentation, and the code are the output of the whole team. Nonetheless, the grades may be adjusted individually if necessary in the case of participation imbalance.
